## How to use

1. Install referenced software: sirula and grim. Alternatively, change the configs to utilize other software.
2. Put the sway config file in the directory ~/.config/sway/
3. If you want to use the wallpaper, place it in ~/Pictures/wallpapers or change the path in the config file appropriately. 
4. Change everything else that you may need to change (particularly input and output settings).
